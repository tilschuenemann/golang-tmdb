# golang-TMDB

This program will to get the TMDB data for your movie directory by parsing your `movie_dir_path` using regex to extract the query and year.


## Disclaimer

This project serves as an exercise for me to learn Golang - there will be a lot of cases where the program will abruptly exit.

Don't consider it stable.
